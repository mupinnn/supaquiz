# SupaQuiz

[PLAY IT NOW!!!](https://supaquiz.netlify.app/)

At first, this project was created to fulfill my responsibility
to complete assignments at [Dicoding Academy](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/163). As time goes by, I decided to put this project on my GitHub.

I learned many things. The interesting one is _Web Component_.
Currently I just implement one part of _Web Component_, is a _custom element_
and there are only two _custom element_ that I implemented.

Since I'm still learning this kind of technology, I'll update this repo gradually.

## Tools

- [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Open TDB API](https://opentdb.com/)

## TODO

- [ ] Refactor all component to _Web Component_.
- [ ] Build optimization.
- [ ] Show result details (answer and questions, which correct and incorrect).
- [ ] Save user progress when accidentally page refreshed or disconnected.
